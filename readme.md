A simple page I created some time ago to preview arbitrary Markdown files with
the same style as you would get in VS Code preview when editing Markdown. So it
uses the same
parser ([markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it)). The
intended use was sharing notes created during classes.

* Supports Markdown.
* Doesn't remove any HTML tags (be careful plz ðŸ¥º).
* Supports LaTeX math.

## Usage

Go to a page with a url like
that ([link](https://aleshkev.github.io/md-preview/?p=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aleshkev/md-preview/master/readme.md)):

    https://aleshkev.github.io/md-preview/?p=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aleshkev/md-preview/master/readme.md

Or, alternatively, copy some Markdown to your clipboard and go the
url ([link](https://aleshkev.github.io/md-preview/)):
