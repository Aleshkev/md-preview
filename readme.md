A simple page I created some time ago to preview arbitrary Markdown files with
the same style as you would get in VS Code preview when editing Markdown. So it
uses the same
parser ([markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it)). The
intended use was sharing notes created during classes.

* Supports Markdown.
* Doesn't remove any HTML tags (be careful plz ðŸ¥º).
* Supports LaTeX math.
